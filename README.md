# What is this?

I like doing competitive programming. I'm sure you like doing competitive programming too if you're looking at this page.

I also happen to do a lot of kattis problems. You probably know what kattis is if you're looking at this page.

I'm composing an archive of all the kattis problems I complete(from the ground up!). If you have any problems you want to commit add them to the src files.

You may have noticed that there is multiple solutions for some problems, but that is a good thing. Maybe one solution is in the language you code in or one of the solutions is more clear.
